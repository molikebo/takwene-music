Veto is a Sudanese rapper and poet known for his compelling lyricism and socially conscious storytelling. Drawing inspiration from icons like Tupac, Biggie, and Travis Scott, he channels his voice into confronting corruption, injustice, and the ongoing conflicts in Sudan.

Veto gained widespread attention through his performance of “Khayana” on the Rap Shar3 (Street Rap) platform.

Veto began composing verses in confined spaces like his car, crafting introspective and hard-hitting narratives.
